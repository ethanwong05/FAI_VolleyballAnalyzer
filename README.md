# FAI_VolleyballAnalyzer
CS5100 Foundations of AI project work. The goal of this project is to create an AI network (Ideally an RCNN) that's trained by a downloaded dataset of videos of different volleyball plays. This analysis should show, rank, and score different plays based on their effectiveness by using computer vision and CNN training.
